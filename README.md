# PyTorch Neural Network Project

This is a PyTorch project that implements a neural network from scratch for image classification. The neural network is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of the project is to achieve high accuracy on the test set of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
